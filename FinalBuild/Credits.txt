Version 1.1.2 [made by Tan Kenji, aka Elite Spec-Ops Alan]
-- Known issues (And may not be fix)--

- Enemy are stupid, they get suck on obstacles and dont know how to maneuver around (A: This project doesn't plan to tackle smart AI, its a beginner game)
- No settings (A: There is no graphics settings, audio, or typical game settings. This is a beginner project, so its not important as most of the things are settled during making of this game)
- No pause menu (A: Sadly, my time is out of reach for now, so a pause menu is not possible for this project. Plus it's not really important for such a small project tbh)
- No restart button after game over? (A: Well i technically can do that, but again, time constrains and design purpose.)

-- Fixed issues --

- Aspect ration locked at 1080p, anything more than that will cause UI issue.
- Highest survived time added alongside reset button.
- mouse cursor didn't show up after player died, causing it unable to continue playing game.
- Balancing issue regarding player able to outrun cats easily.
